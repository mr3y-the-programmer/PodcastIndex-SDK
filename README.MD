# PodcastIndex-SDK

## About
Unofficial Type-safe PodcastIndex SDK for Kotlin Multiplatform Supporting Android/Desktop/iOS platforms.
[Podcast Index](https://podcastindex.org/) is a large, categorized, and free index of podcasts. It offers a REST API to access the index.

}
```
In Kotlin Multiplatform projects, add the dependency:
```kotlin
commonMain {
    dependencies {
        implementation("io.github.mr3y-the-programmer:podcastindex-sdk:<latest-version>")
    }
}
```
Or in a single-platform project:
```kotlin
dependencies {
   implementation("io.github.mr3y-the-programmer:podcastindex-sdk:<latest-version>")
}
```
**Compatibility**:

   - Kotlin 1.9+.

## How to use
1. Initialize client instance by calling `PodcastIndexClient`:
```kotlin
val client = PodcastIndexClient(/*your API key*/, /*your API secret*/, /*User agent (i.e "MyPodcastApp/1.2"*/) {
    // Optionally, this function provides a lambda that allows you to customize/configure the client 
    enableLogging = if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) true else false
    // you can also configure things like loggingTag, maxRetries, defaultTimeout..etc
}
```
### Search Service
<details>
  <summary><b>Search Podcasts by term: Click Here to See</b></summary>

````kotlin
// This method takes other optional parameters like limit, includeSimilar...etc that allow you to fine-tune the search result.
val result: MultiplePodcastsResult = client.search.forPodcastsByTerm(term = "android")
````
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Search Podcasts by title: Click Here to See</b></summary>

````kotlin
// This method takes other optional parameters like limit, includeSimilar...etc that allow you to fine-tune the search result.
val result: MultiplePodcastsResult = client.search.forPodcastsByTitle(title = "Talking Kotlin")
````
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Search Episodes by person: Click Here to See</b></summary>

````kotlin
val result: MultipleEpisodesResult = client.search.forEpisodesByPerson(name = "john doe")
````
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Search Music Podcasts by term: Click Here to See</b></summary>

````kotlin
val result: MultiplePodcastsResult = client.search.forMusicPodcastsByTerm(term = "music")
````
</details>
Similarly, accessing **Podcasts**, **Episodes** endpoints follows the same approach.
